Introduction
-------------
Hi everyone, my name is Nick Thomson, I'm a software engineer here at Cloudspace
and this talk is an Introduction to AngularJS.

Here at Cloudspace, we're using AngularJS to power our front-end apps.
Its a great framework that has some really neat stuff that I'm very excited about.
Hopefully by the end of this talk, you'll be excited about it too.


What is angular?
----------------
  - Javascript Framework for web apps
  - HTML if it had been written for web applications
  - Model-View-Whatever (Where whatever stands for "Whatever works for you")


Five D's of Angular
-------------------
  - Directives (angular)
    - Extensions to HTML
    - If you've seen angular code, you may have seen them (ng-model, ng-click)
  - Data-binding
    - $scope updates based on your view
  - Dependency Injection
    - Keeps your app modular, easier refactoring, easier testing
  - Declarative Views
    - Interfaces should be declarative
    - Views should describe what components you want to show, not how those components are implemented
  - Directives (custom)

Data-binding
------------
I'd like to go over some these a little bit more in depth,
and the first one I'd like to talk about is data-binding
